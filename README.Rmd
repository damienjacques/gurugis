# Gurugis - the voice of GISdom <img src='man/figures/logo.png' align="right" height="139" />

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of gurugis is to provide a series of functions useful to the regular GIS spatial analysis workflow.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("damienjacques/gurugis")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to make quick zonal statistics from a raster and a vector layer describing the areas:

```{r example}
library(gurugis)
library(raster)
library(sf)

# raster file for which I want to compute zonal statistics
plot(precipitation)

# vector layer with the zones
plot(belgium[10], main = "Belgium ADM 3")

# compute average of precipiation in each zone
output <- zonal_pipe(precipitation, belgium, stats = "mean")

# plot 6 first months
plot(output[18:23])
```
